# DoubleU
Our final project in MiLab Studio 2020, as part of participation in the Media Innovation Lab.

DoubleU, was established in March 2020 during Corona Virus era where social distancing was encouraged, and a pandemic was threatening our well-being. We identified a need among the elderly for connection between them and their families. That said, during this time only technological measures could be taken into an account, since meeting friends and family could be too much of a risk. Moreover, not all elderly have the right knowledge to operate cellphones, computers, tablets or other technological devices. The purpose of the venture is to narrow the Elderly’s technological gap and help them be a part of today’s world.

Double U's product is consisted of an Android application for the volunteers, and a physical button for the elderly, which can be placed anywhere in their home.

DoubleU is a technological prototype that was created by students of the Media Innovation Lab of the School of Communication of IDC Herzliya. https://www.idc.ac.il/en/pages/home.aspx http://milab.idc.ac.il
